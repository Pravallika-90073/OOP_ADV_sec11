//Java Memory Model â€“ Stack vs Heap, Object Lifecycle
//A game app frequently creates temporary Player objects during gameplay and destroys them when not needed.
//Create a Player class and override finalize() to print when it is garbage collected.
//In main, create several temporary player objects inside a loop.
//Use System.gc() and explain when objects are eligible for GC.
