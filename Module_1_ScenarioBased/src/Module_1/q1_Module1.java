//A school management system wants to store details of teachers including name, ID, and subject. Each time a teacher object is created, the system should assign a unique ID automatically.
//Create a class Teacher with instance variables for name, id, and subject.
//Use a static counter to auto-generate unique IDs.
//Create a constructor to initialize the values and display the details of each teacher object.
